Op-Amps-101
===========


Wanted to make a pH sensor? 
Make a noise-canceller?
Make a custom equalizer?
Mini microphones?

Improve your circuitry with this intro to Analog Circuit Design -- with focus on Op Amps, Instrumental Amplifiers, analog comparators, and opto-isolators.


## Op Amps Are Fun

### Topology Checklist:

* [ ] inverting amplifier (simple volume control)
* [ ] non-inverting amplifier (simple buffer, and amplifier)
* [ ] summing-amplifier (single speaker multiple tones)
* [ ] differential amplifier (matched pair analysis) 
* [ ] bridge amplifier (force sensor)
* [ ] logarithmic amplifier (compressor)
* [ ] frequency filter 

### Project Checklist:
* [ ] Music: compressor
* [ ] Music: fuzz
* [ ] Music: phasor
* [ ] Music: make-an-instrument
* [ ] Science: pH Sensor
* [ ] Science: Soil Moisture Sensor
* [ ] Science: Light Sensor
* [ ] Science: Strain Gauge Sensor
* [ ] Science: Thermopile sensor
* [ ] Science: Oxygen Sensor
* [ ] Cool: Alpha-Wave-Detector
* [ ] Robotics: Force-Feedback-sensor
* [ ] Robotics: Frequency sensor (whistle-bot)
* [ ] Robotics: Opto-coupling
* [ ] Embedded: single-supply RR op Amps

### Cool Ic's

**Myth:** hardware is expensive
**Fact:** IC samples are free (especially if you can solder)

* [ ] RR Op Amp, a few suggestions, a few sample sites
* [ ] ultra-high input impedence, low offset usage
* [ ] instrumental amplification (pricey, lower bandwidth but very powerful for medical applications)
* [ ] High power op amps
* [ ] Analog Comparators -- do the job.
* [ ] create md-doc with sample diagrams of the most important (IMO) op amp configurations
* [ ] create md-doc with description of op-amp limitations/"non-idealities" and what applications they are important concerns
* [ ] create md-doc to create a set of projects each common topology
